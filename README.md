## 1. Algorithmic Trading Overview

Algorithmic trading uses computer programs to execute trades based on predefined criteria.

It aims to optimize trading efficiency, reduce costs, and minimize human error.

Common strategies include trend following, mean reversion, and arbitrage.

### Trading Algorithm 101

Trading algorithms are codes designed to execute an order or orders, according to a predefined strategy.

In terms of simple flowchart, a trading algorithm can be represented as follows:

- **Input Market Data**: The algorithm receives real-time market data, including prices, volumes, and other relevant
  information.
- **Analyze Data**: The algorithm analyzes the incoming data using predefined rules and strategies.
- **Generate Signals**: Based on the analysis, the algorithm generates buy or sell or hold signals.
- **Execute Orders**: The algorithm executes the trades based on the generated signals.
- **Monitor Performance**: The algorithm continuously monitors the performance of executed trades and adjusts
  strategies as needed.
- **Output Results**: The algorithm provides feedback on trade outcomes and overall performance.
- **End Process**: The trading process concludes, and the algorithm awaits new market data to repeat the cycle.

There is another aspect of trading like **risk management** and **compliance** which is not covered here.
